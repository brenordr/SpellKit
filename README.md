# Rune v0.1

ReactiveStore is a lightweight state management library designed to bring reactivity to your applications. By using modern JavaScript features like ES6 Proxies, ReactiveStore allows you to seamlessly interact with your state, abstracting away the complexities of manual state management.

## üåü Benefits:

1. **Simplicity**: No boilerplate code. Just create a store, and you're good to go.
2. **Reactivity**: Thanks to the use of ES6 Proxies, any changes to the store will automatically reflect wherever the state is used.
3. **Flexibility**: Works well with any front-end library or framework, including React, Vue, and vanilla JavaScript projects.
4. **Type Safety**: Built with TypeScript, ensuring type safety and better developer experience.

## üöÄ Getting Started:

(Add installation instructions, API documentation, and a few basic examples here.)

## üõ£ Roadmap:

As we continue to enhance ReactiveStore, here are some features we're excited to bring in the upcoming versions:

1. **Middlewares**: Introduce middleware support to intercept and augment the store's operations.
2. **DevTools Integration**: Connect with popular browser DevTools for better debugging and state visualization.
3. **Batched Updates**: Optimize reactivity by batching rapid state changes to prevent unnecessary renders.
4. **Async Operations**: Out-of-the-box support for asynchronous actions and state updates.
5. **Selectors**: Allow derived state and memoization for optimized reactivity.
6. **Plugin System**: Extend the core functionalities by introducing a plugin system.
7. **Improved React Integration**: Offer hooks and components for a tighter integration with React.
